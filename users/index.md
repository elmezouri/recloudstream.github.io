# Cloudstream
An Android app to stream and download Movies, TV-Shows and Animes
This [open source app](https://github.com/recloudstream/cloudstream) can stream any media content from various sources

### Disclaimer ⚠️
The app is purely for educational and personal use.

CloudStream 3 does not host any content on the app, and has no control over what media is put up or taken down. CloudStream 3 functions like any other search engine, such as Google. CloudStream 3 does not host, upload or manage any videos, films or content. It simply crawls, aggregates and displayes links in a convenient, user-friendly interface.

It merely scrapes 3rd-party websites that are publicly accessible via any regular web browser.

It is the responsibility of user to avoid any actions that might violate the laws governing his/her locality.

### What are the risks in practice?
Basically none. The content is hosted by the "providers", and if you don't distribute the content yourself, you are pretty much safe

A lot of misleading articles online try to scare people into buying a VPN subscription when the authors are earning a big commission (sometimes 100% of the VPN subscription).
VPNs are useful for certain things but aren't a magical tool and most people don't need those

Basicaly this app send requests to different websites (also called sources or providers) to find movies, series and animes and display them in the app nicely
