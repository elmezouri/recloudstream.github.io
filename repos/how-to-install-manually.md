# How to install manually

To install a repo manually, you need its link.
If you are using [our website's](./index.md) list, you can get it by long pressing the <kbd>Install</kbd> button and clicking `Copy link address`.

## Adding the link
After obtaining the link, you should open the Cloudstream app, go to `Settings > Extensions > Add repository`.

When pasting the link, make sure it doesnt start with `cs.repo`. If it does, remove that.
